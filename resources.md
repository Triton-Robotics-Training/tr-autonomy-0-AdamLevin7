# TR CV Training Resources

## THINGS YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO READ:

- Chapters 1-11 of https://www.learncpp.com/, as well as the smart pointers sections in M.6 & M.7.
- The [ROS2 Humble docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble), specifically [**Concepts > Basic Concepts**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Basic.html), [**Tutorials > Beginner CLI Tools**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html), and [**Tutorials > Beginner Client Libraries**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries.html). **If you are having trouble understanding ROS2, this is the best resource.**

## Things that are super useful to know about:

- OpenCV Resources
  - [Getting Started with OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/getting-started-with-opencv/) by [learnopencv.com](https://learnopencv.com) is great
  - Understanding [color spaces in OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/color-spaces-in-opencv-cpp-python/) and [distance in the HSV space](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35114586)
  - [Morphological Operations in OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d61/tutorial_py_morphological_ops.html) for reducing noise in masks
  - [3D with OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/db7/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_calib3d.html) as we use the pose estimation utilities from OpenCV
- Advanced C++ Knowledge
  - [Function Pointers and Lambdas](https://www.learncpp.com/#:~:text=Chapter%C2%A020-,Functions,-20.1) (Chapter 20 of learncpp)
  - [std::bind](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-and-examples-of-bind-in-cpp-stl/)
- Intermediate ROS2
  - [Launch Files](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Creating-Launch-Files.html) We use these to make running multiple nodes easier.
